# C-Bos
 A command-line app made in C++ for fun.

 This used to be the main cbos but I rewrote it in python and now this is a side project

 This probably will almost never get updated btw

# How to use
 If you dont want to compile from source then just download the latest version and run the exe

 Then type `help`

# How to compile from source
 Install [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) installed (search up a tutorial on how to install it)

 Then run `g++ main.cpp` in the cbos dir and it should be compiled!

 Also the exe only works on windows but you can just compile it for your platform.
